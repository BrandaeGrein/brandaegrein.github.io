								As of July, I became an offical Unity Certified Instructor. 
								This was a huge personal achievement, as I earned this badge alongside my Bachelor's of Computer Science.

							<p style = "text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/743a51d4-d35b-4787-a5ef-7cbf47872203/public_url"><img src = "images/unity-certified-professional-programmer.png" style = "float: left; width: 200px"></a> 
								In order to earn my UCI certification, I passed the Unity Certified Programmer exam on July 25th, 2020. 
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<p style = "text-align: left;">On June 19th, 2020, I graduated from Bellevue College with my Bachelor of Science: Computer Science and earned the Cum Laude distinction with a GPA of 3.68. Previous
								to this, I had earned a two year Associate degree in Arts and Sciences in 2013. My senior capstone project earned awards prior to graduation as well, earning both first place for 
								Best Poster Design as well as second place for Best Overall Project.

								In Feburary of 2020, my work in virtual reality was recognized by the International Game Developer's Association Foundation through their Velocity award. Although I did not end up going to 
								the Game Developer's Conference via this scholarship, I was instead granted an amazing opportunity to be a part of an eight week online program over the summer. Click on the IGDA Foundation logo 
								to see all of this year's winners.

							<p style = "text-align: left;">
								While at Bellevue College, I was both the founder and president of the Virtual Reality club. While we started with only 4 members in May of 2018, by the time I graduated we had grown
								to over 150+ people on our mailing list, with an average of 17 attendees per weekly meeting.
